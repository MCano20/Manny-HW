            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>Radioactive particles that are carried into the atmosphere <br> after a nuclear explosion or accident
                and gradually fall <br> back as dust or in precipitation.</p>

                <h2>Two types of radiation</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Thermal Radiation</h3>
                <p id="p96">A single nuclear explosion can generate an intense pulse <br> of thermal radiation that can start
                    fires and burn skin <br> over large areas. In some cases, the fires ignited by the <br> explosion
                    can lead into a firestorm, preventing the escape <br> of survivors. Though difficult to predict
                    accurately, it is <br> expected that thermal effects from a nuclear explosion <br> would be the
                    cause of significant casualties.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Inital Radiation</h3>
                <p>Nuclear detonations release large amounts of neutron and <br> gamma radiation. Relative to other
                    effects, initial radiation <br> is an important cause of casualties only for low-yield <br>
                    explosions (less than 10 kilotons).</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Aftermath</h2>
            <p>When a nuclear detonation occurs close to the ground <br> surface, soil mixes with the highly
                radioactive fission <br> products from the weapon. The debris is carried by <br> the wind and falls
                back to Earth over a period of minutes <br> to hours.</p>
